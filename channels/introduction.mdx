---

Every customer interaction requires a communication medium. To establish and maintain long living customer relations we need those. Channels have two different type of ports: **inbound** and **outbound**. \
\
Each channel, without an exception, has one and only inbound port where you can connect a MAS to automate inbound. Some channels (currently only email) have also outbound ports, which means you can connect those to **Campaigns** to reach out your customers. When available, number of outbound ports of a channel is not limited so they can be connected to more than one **Campaign.**

<Info>
  Currently, we support Storefront Messenger, Email, Instagram, and Facebook channels. We’re also working on SMS and Phone (voice). Both will support inbound and outbound communication—meaning you’ll be able to automate incoming SMS messages and calls, while also proactively reaching out to customers via SMS or phone calls.
