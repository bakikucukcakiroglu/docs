**Inbox** brings all your customer conversations together in one place—no matter which channel they come from or if they are inbound or outbound. Email, storefront, Instagram and Facebook all flow into a single unified view.

\
From here, you can follow every conversation, respond to customers, update statuses, leave internal notes, and collaborate with your team—all without jumping between different tools or tabs.
