You can integrate your email accounts with **lookfor** to centralize all customer conversations and automate responses with MAS. We currently support two connection methods:

- **Gmail OAuth** (only for Gmail / Google Workspace users, convenient but limited)
- **Lookfor Subdomain Setup** (recommended for all providers, including Gmail — unlimited & highly reliable)

<Info>
  **Important:** Your customers will **continue sending emails to your original support email address**.\
  With the Lookfor Subdomain Setup, you simply configure your email provider to _forward_ your incoming messages to lookfor. Replies sent by lookfor will originate from your **lookfor subdomain email** (e.g.,`support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`).

## Gmail OAuth Setup

The easiest and fastest way to connect your Gmail inbox. However, Google enforces strict sending/reading limits — see Google’s official limits [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en&src=supportwidget0&authuser=0).

**_Because of these limits, Gmail OAuth is not the recommended long-term method_**, especially for stores with moderate or high email volume.

### Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
2. Click **Add Email** → choose **Gmail**.
3. Sign in with the Google account (Gmail or Google Workspace) you want to connect.
4. Grant the necessary permissions (read, send, manage mail).
5. You’re done — your Gmail inbox starts syncing immediately.

## Lookfor Subdomain Setup

This method works with any email provider (Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail, custom domains, etc.)\
and has **no limits**, because lookfor handles sending/receiving using a subdomain you select like [support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai](mailto:support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai)

You will configure email forwarding in your own provider so that **emails sent to your original support address** (e.g. `support@yourdomain.com`) are forwarded to lookfor.

This means:

- Customers keep using **your normal support email**
- lookfor **receives** the forwarded emails
- lookfor **replies** from `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`with reply-to set as `THREAD_ID+support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`
- Customer replies go back to that lookfor address → and the thread continues smoothly

### Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
2. Click **Add Email** → select **Lookfor Subdomain Setup**.
3. Choose a subdomain (e.g., `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`) and click **Create Email Account**.\
   This creates the email integration and automatically sets up the required DNS records.
4. Wait for DNS propagation.\
   You can check the status anytime by clicking **Validate**.
5. In your original email provider, set up **email forwarding**\
   (e.g., forward `support@yourdomain.com` → `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`).
6. Once DNS is valid and forwarding is active, lookfor will activate the integration and start receiving emails.
