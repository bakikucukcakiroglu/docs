You can integrate your email accounts with **lookfor** to centralize all customer conversations and automate responses with MAS. We currently support two connection methods:

- **Gmail OAuth** — only for Gmail/Google Workspace users. Easy to set up but limited by Google’s sending and reading quotas.
- **Lookfor Subdomain Setup** — recommended for all providers, including Gmail. Fully reliable with no limits.

## How to Automate Emails?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Connect your email to lookfor">
    1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
    2. Click **Add Email**.
    3. Choose and complete a connection method:
       - **Gmail OAuth** → see the [Gmail OAuth Setup](#gmail-oauth-setup)\
         _(Convenient but limited)_
       - **Lookfor Subdomain Setup** → see the [Lookfor Subdomain Setup](#lookfor-subdomain-setup)\
         _(Recommended, unlimited, reliable)_

    <Check>
      Once your email is connected, all messages immediately begin appearing in the **Unified Inbox**.\
      Even before automation is enabled, you can use Unified Inbox as a full-featured email client for that account.

  <Step title="Step 2: Create an Email MAS">
    1. Go to the **MASs** page.
    2. Click **Create new Email MAS**.
    3. Configure your MAS and its agents as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Assign the Email MAS to an Email Integration">
    1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
    2. Open the email integration you connected.
    3. Assign the Email MAS you created.

    After assignment, the MAS will automatically run for every incoming email on that integration.

## Gmail OAuth Setup

Gmail OAuth is the quickest way to connect a Gmail or Google Workspace inbox.\
However, Google enforces strict daily sending and reading limits. You can review these limits [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852?hl=en)

Because of these quotas, Gmail OAuth is not ideal for stores with medium or high email volume.

### Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
2. Click **Add Email** → choose **Gmail**.
3. Sign in with your Gmail or Google Workspace account.
4. Grant the required permissions (read, send, manage mail).
5. Your Gmail inbox will begin syncing immediately.

## Lookfor Subdomain Setup

This method works with any email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, IONOS, custom domain hosts, etc.) and has **no limits**, because lookfor sends and receives mail through a subdomain you select, such as `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`.

Your original support address (e.g., `support@yourdomain.com`) remains the public address your customers see.\
You simply configure your current email provider to **forward incoming emails** to your new lookfor subdomain address.

lookfor will:

- Receive all forwarded messages.
- Reply from your subdomain address (e.g., `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`).
- Use a unique reply-to address like `THREAD_ID+support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai` to preserve conversation threads.
- Automatically route all customer replies into the correct thread in your Unified Inbox.

### Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Channels → Email**.
2. Click **Add Email** → select **Lookfor Subdomain Setup**.
3. Choose a subdomain (e.g., `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`) and click **Create Email Account**.\
   This creates the email integration and automatically generates the required DNS records.
4. Wait for DNS propagation.\
   You can check the current status anytime by clicking **Validate** inside the integration.
5. In your original email provider, configure **email forwarding**\
   (e.g., forward `support@yourdomain.com` → `support@yourstore.in.lookfor.ai`).
6. When DNS is valid and forwarding is active, lookfor will activate the integration and begin receiving emails.
