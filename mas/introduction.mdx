Multi-agent systems (MASs) are teams of [agents](/mas/agents) that collaborate to achieve a shared objective. Instead of having one agent handle everything, MASs allow you to split responsibilities across multiple agents and define how they work together.

The **orchestration logic**—which agents run, in what order, and how decisions are made—is defined at the MAS level. The MAS uses LLM intelligence to reason through this flow using system instructions, handoffs, and tools.

### You are in full control

People often think lookfor provides a pre-defined agentic system. However, this is not what we do.  We very well know that each store has its own unique requirements. We can’t create a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, what we provide is a framework and infrastructure that you can use to build and run your own MASs smoothly. 

### Creating a MAS 

A MAS is actually nothing more than a container for agents. So most of the work to create a successfull MAS goes to [creating agents](agents#creating-agents). However, there are still some configurations you need to make for your MAS. 

- `Name` - The name of the MAS. It is used to identify the MAS in the dashboard.
- `Type` - [The type of the MAS. ](#mas-types) It is set when you create a MAS and cannot be changed later.
- `Entry Agent` - Every MAS must define one entry agent. That is, the agent who is the starting point of the execution. 
- `System Instructions` - Optional high-level guidance to steer the overall behavior of the MAS. This applies to all agents in the MAS and superior to their own instructions. 
- **Type Specific Settings** - These settings are specific to the [type of the MAS](/mas/introduction#mas-types).

### **MAS Types**

The tools and context available to agents and the final output of a MAS depend on the **type** of MAS they belong to. The following are the types of MASs, you can find more details including `context variables`, `tools`, `type specific settings` and `output structure` about each type in the following guides:

- [**Storefront MASs**](https://docs.lookfor.ai/guides/storefront-mas) -Used to power chatbot conversations on your storefront.
- [**Email MASs**](https://docs.lookfor.ai/guides/email-mas) - Handle and respond to customer emails.

Other types like `content` or `insights` are coming soon.

### **Output of a MAS**

There are two different types of things that can be inferred as the output of a MAS:

- **Text-based output** - This is the output of the final agent (the last working agent in a run) in a MAS. Final output type is pre-determined by the type of the MAS.
- **Tool executions** - These are the side effect created by tool executions not only by the final agent but all the agents in a run.

Let’s say we have a Storefront MAS. What your customer see in the chatbot as a response is the text-based output of the final agent. However, let’s sat they asked to cancel an order and Orders Agent run `cancel_order` tool to cancel the order. Execution of this tool is also a part of the output of the MAS since it contribures to the expected achievement of the MAS.

Notice that the agent executing a tool may not be the final agent in the MAS. For example, `Orders Agent` may run `cancel_order` tool to cancel an order and then hand off to `Refund Agent` to refund the order. In this case, the `Refund Agent` is the final agent in the run and the output of the MAS is the text-based output of the `Refund Agent`.

### **MAS Orchestration**

The orchestration of agents within a MAS is configured together with MAS level and Agent level settings. These include:

- `entryAgent` (MAS level) Every MAS must define one entry agent. That is, the agent who is the starting point of the execution.
- `handoffs` (Agent level)\
  Defined inside individual agents to control how they delegate tasks.

Long story short, the MAS starts with the entry agent and then may delegate to other agents based on the handoffs. In the meantime, the total of tools executed through the process and the output generated by the final agent is the output of the MAS.
