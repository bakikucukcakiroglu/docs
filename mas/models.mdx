Your agents are powered by advanced AI language models (LLMs), which act as the “brain” behind the scenes. You can configure these models to control how your agents behave.

### **Model Options**

Each model tier offers a different balance of speed, cost, and intelligence:

- **<Tooltip tip="">Express</Tooltip>** – Lightweight and fast. Ideal for simple tasks and quick replies.
- **Core** _(default)_ – A balanced choice. Handles most customer interactions well.
- **Ultra** – The most advanced. Excels at understanding complex requests and reasoning step-by-step, though slightly slower.

> **Tip:** Start with **Express** to keep your agents fast and cost-efficient. If you notice performance issues or more complex needs, upgrade to **Core** or **Ultra**. For critical tasks, we recommend using **Ultra**.

### **Additional Settings**

- **Tool Choice** – Controls how the agent uses tools:
  - `"auto"` _(default)_: Model decides when to use tools
  - `"required"`: Tools must always be used
  - `"none"`: Tool usage is disabled
- **Parallel Tool Calls** – Enables calling multiple tools at once.
  - `true` or `false` _(default: false)_

<Note>
  **Caution**

  Advanced settings come with safe defaults. Changing them without understanding their effect may lead to unexpected behavior. Only modify these if you’re confident in what they do.
