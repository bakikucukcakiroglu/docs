### Overview

Context is a set of variables that are available to the MAS. In essence, there are certain information we expect to have when executing a MAS.(e.g. `name`, `country`, `IP Address`, `email` etc.) For each MAS type, information information likely to exist during execution is placed into context variables of that MAS. Thanks to that, you can use these variables in your [instructions](/mas/instructions#personalizing-responses-with-context-variables) to build your workflows. When available, variables will be replaced with their value during MAS execution. 

### **Variables**

The context variables are different for each type of the MAS. See the list of the context variables for each type:
