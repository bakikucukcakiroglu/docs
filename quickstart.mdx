<Info>
  We start syncing your store data to our system when you first logged in. It usually takes \*\*5-30 \*\*mins depending on the size of your store. Wait until you receive “You store is synced successfully” email in your store’s email. If you have any problem or need help with setup, [contact us.](mailto:ebrar@lookfor.ai)

## Start automating your customer relations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integrate a channel">
    Every customer interaction requires a communication medium. In our case they are called [channels](/channels/introduction). Integrating your channels is a good first step. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a MAS ">
    Create your first storefront multi-agent system on [MAS editor](https://dashboard.lookfor.ai/app/multi-agent-systems). Guide to create a storefront MAS is [here](https://docs.lookfor.ai/guides/multi-agent-systems).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign MAS to your channel's inbound">
    You need to assign a MAS to your channel's inbound port so that MAS can start to work on incoming inquiries. 

    <Info>
      Some channels (email, SMS, and voice) also have outbound port, which means you can create Campaigns to reach customer without waiting for them to reach you but this is a different story.
