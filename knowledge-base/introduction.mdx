We said that LLMs are brains of agents earlier. If you don't know what is LLM or what is Multi Agent System you may consider reading  [Multi Agent Systems.](/mas/introduction) LLMs are not like a tabula rasa, which means they all come with built in information about the universe. Depending on the data they were trained on they may know about your brand or even your "cancellation policy". However, by their nature the information they have can be obselete or a hallucination. That is why we want to make important knowledge available to our agents by providing fresh data. There are different kinds of knowledge items in lookfor. They are **FAQs**, **PDFs**, **Products**, **Collections**, **Pages**, and **Blogs.** 

| **FAQs**       | **PDFs**       | **Products**                      | **Collections**                   | **Pages**                         | **Blogs**                         |
