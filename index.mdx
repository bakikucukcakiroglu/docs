## Core Components

Our platform uses three core components to make scalable customer relationships possible. **Channels** are gateways that connect your brand with customers. You can connect a **MAS** to a channel’s **inbound** port to automate incoming conversations, or create a campaign using the channel’s **outbound** port to proactively reach out to customers.
