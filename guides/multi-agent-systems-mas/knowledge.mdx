Every agent in a multi-agent system (MAS) uses an LLM as its “brain.” LLMs contain a lot of general knowledge, but that knowledge can be outdated, and LLMs can sometimes hallucinate and produce incorrect information.

To reduce these risks and give agents access to up-to-date, reliable data, you typically have two options:

## 1. Web search

Allow agents to retrieve the latest information from the web when needed. To enable this, assign the **Web Search** tool to the agent so it can perform live searches when required.

## 2. Knowledge base

Maintain and grow a curated knowledge base (e.g., FAQs, PDFs, products, collections, pages, blog articles) so agents can rely on validated sources instead of guessing.

### How knowledge is added and kept up to date

- **FAQs and PDFs** are added manually by merchants from the Shopify dashboard.
- **Products and collections** are synced automatically, and changes are reflected instantly—no manual interaction required.
- **Pages and blog articles** are synced automatically on a predefined schedule. If you want changes to be reflected immediately, click **Sync** on the Knowledge Base page.

In the Lookfor dashboard, all knowledge types can be listed, reviewed, and managed from the **Knowledge Base** section.

### Tools agents use to access knowledge

- `Get Related Knowledge Source`: Lets agents search and retrieve relevant items across all knowledge types. If you want an agent to use your knowledge base, assign this tool to that agent.
- `Get Recommended Products`: Lets agents recommend products using your store’s products and collections. If you want an agent to make product recommendations, assign this tool to that agent.

<Info>
  Get Related Knowledge Source, Get Recommended Products, and Web Serach are **pre-defined function tools** and can be used across **any MAS type**.
