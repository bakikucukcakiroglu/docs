## **Sounds cool BUT isn’t it simply a chatbot?**

Yes and no. Let me explain it to you clearly. [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are machine learning models that are designed to understand and generate human language. The concept of LLMs goes back to 90s but the recent breakthroughs in the field of LLMs have made them more powerful and versatile. Chatbot developers saw the potential and started building chatbots using LLMs. From a technical perspective, a chatbot is a proxy for an LLM. It takes a user’s input, adds some context, sends it to an LLM, and displays the output. The concept is cool but its capabilities are limited. It cannot take actions, almost only words. In short, chatbots also use LLMs but as a text answer generator.

A multi-agent system is a more powerful tool. It is the state of the art concept in the field of using LLMs as a unit of intelligence. Rather than using LLMs as a text answer generator, it uses LLMs as a unit of intelligence. It is a system that consists of multiple agents. Each agent is a proxy for an LLM. Each agent has a set of tools and context. Each agent can use these tools and context to complete its task. In short, LLM is the brain of the agent, tools are the hands and context is the eyes. MAS is a team of agents that can work together to complete a task.
